							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<h3>Unit 1</h3>
								<p>As in all previous modules, I have tried to get as far ahead as possible in the first few weeks by reading material.  I have increased my knowledge in ethics in computing, and learnt more about various codes of conduct (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018: British Computer Society, N.D.), the Belmont and Menlo Reports, various legislation, and the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning (Miessler, 2020).  I have also begun to learn how to formulate a research project (Dawson, 2015).  I was able to put this together coherently into my reflective activity piece.</p>
							<h3>Unit 2</h3>
								<p>I have learnt lots more about the various methods of research through further reading, including the difference between qualitative and quantitative research, and primary and secondary research (QuestionPro, N.D.).   I have also discovered others’ ways of thinking regarding ethics in relation to the ACM case studies.  Ags particularly enlightened me to discriminatory issues, as well as how to escalate them (Angelides, 2022).  This helped me form a broader consideration for the topic and understand points of view that I may not have otherwise seen.</p>
							<h3>Unit 3</h3>
								<p>Unfortunately, I have gone into this week feeling low and frustrated.  I do not seem to have an academic understanding of how the various components of research link together within the modules: i.e., Literature Review, Research Proposal, and the final project.  My tutor has helped me substantially and I now feel foolish that I am not able to get a grasp on it.  I am sure this will come together eventually, however it has prevented me from really progressing in the module and has left me feeling very worried.  I feel I have however, grasped a new respect for the ethical issues in computing through reading and the lecturecast from unit 1, especially where the Internet is concerned (Stahl et al., 2016).  In writing my summary post, I realised how this made sense to me and I will carry this forward in any future work that I do.</p>
							<h3>Unit 4</h3>
								<p>I have been unable to move forward in my literature review due to the lack of understanding of how it fits in with the research proposal and the project.  This has left me feeling very frustrated and now dispirited.  I did however, through the unit reading learn of the various benefits and pitfalls of different data gathering techniques, especially for case studies, in observing (Farquhar, 2012), and focus groups (Sim & Waterfield, 2019).</p>
							<h3>Unit 5</h3>
								<p>The Reflective Activity 2 directly allowed me to learn how questionnaires can be used to exploit respondents who complete them.  It is the researcher’s responsibility to protect such data, especially in the case of collecting PII.  It is important we do not cause harm when involving persons as part of our research, and that we respect their privacy.  The seminar for this week stressed the importance of anonymising the source of information, asking for consent when conducting questionnaires, and that data protection should be administered as it is ultimately owned by respondents and not by researchers.  Through the lecturecast, I was also able to learn the advantages and disadvantages of using methods such as face-to-face interviews and remote questionnaires, and when to use them.</p>
							<h3>Unit 6</h3>
								<p>Through this week’s lecturecast, I learnt how complex proper questionnaire design is and that it is not simply writing questions randomly.  I learnt the importance of orderly questionnaire design, how to avoid using poor question structures such as using leading questions, and how to maximise the amount of valid responses.  I also learnt the difference between surveys and questionnaires, pre- and post-testing, and how to analyse responses.  My understanding was further strengthened by the reading materials, in particular the wiki activity that allowed me to dive further into analysing a questionnaire, using the UK Government (2011) as a case study.</p>
