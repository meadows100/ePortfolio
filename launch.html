							<h2>Artefacts</h2>
							<h3>Discussion 1</h3>
							<p>Cyber Security is now a concern for everyone, whether we like it or not.  Companies can gain value from proving that they have sufficient security measures put in place on their systems, however ensuring that their partner’s systems are secure is proving just as important.  Businesses are more likely to partner with organisations that can prove their compliance with laws and regulations, and this works two fold.  For example, by gaining accreditation such as PCI-DSS, a series of security controls must be put in place.  This has the obvious benefit of securing their systems and data, however it also secures the trust that others have in them.  A business can show their customers and partners they are safer to deal with.  With the adoption of cloud computing and the change of work patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic, security can no longer always be centralised and the recent spate of attacks on 3rd party providers headlining in the news shows the importance for organisations to check the compliance of businesses they do business with.  Recent victims of such attacks include attacks on VoIP providers, MIMECast and perhaps most notoriously, SolarWinds.  The latter helps organisations manage their network and applications, and was previously a trusted name.  However, when hackers compromised their Orion product in 2020, it affected customers worldwide including businesses and the US Military.  (Constantin, 2020).  Such stories should not be surprising when in a recent UK survey, only 12% of businesses admitted they reviewed risks from their immediate supply chain.  (UK Government, 2021).  Any organisation that neglects putting in measures to protect themselves and ensure their wider boundaries are secure risk cyber attacks and data breaches.  This leaves them open not only to financial implications, but with an intangible cost of loss of customer confidence and lost future business.</p?

								<p>Now that you have the necessary pages, you just need to fill them with the required information.  Please see the section “e-portfolio learning activities” on your programme page for more information on the artefacts required for each module.  Be sure to include feedback on these artefacts that you’ve received from your peers and tutors.  If the artefact is a piece of code, you can push the Git from Codio to GitHub for storage and feedback.  Please see the Codio guide pages for more on this.</p>
							<h2>Meeting Notes</h2>
								<p>It’s essential to keep a record of what your team’s activities in line with the guidelines set out on teamwork (see the Department of Computing page).  You should also record outcomes of any meetings with your tutor and as well as feedback you have received.</p>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<p>If you are not given specific guidelines in the module for the format of this piece, you should produce a piece of reflective writing that covers 3 key points, the 3 W’s.  These are described below, along with some basic examples covering experience and learning:

Criteria	Example 1	Example 2
What?

(Description - the shortest part of your reflection)

Experience

What heppened?
Who was involved?
Learning

On what concept/idea/theory am I reflecting?
Specific tasks were shared out amongst members of my team. However, the tasks were not seen as equally difficult by all team members.	
I secured a placement for one year in the human resources department of the Liverpool John Lewis store in Liverpool. As ‘Partners’ in the business, all employees are encouraged to become invested in the business through staff forums and business-performance related bonuses.  

This was not a type of business which I had come across in my studies, and so it was a change from what I was expecting.

So What?

(Interpretation - now you analyse)

Experience

What is most important / interesting / relevant / useful aspect of the event or situation?
How can it be explained? Why did it happen?
How is it similar to and/or different from others?
Learning

What is most important / interesting / relevant / useful, or even challenging, aspect of the idea / concept / theory?
Does it tie in with anything I learned in the past?
Has this changed the way I think, or confirmed something I already knew?
Cooperation between group members was at risk because of this perception of unfairness. Social interdependence theory recognises a type of group interaction called ‘positive interdependence’, meaning cooperation (Johnson & Johnson, 1993, cited by Maughan & Webb, 2001), and many studies have demonstrated that “cooperative learning experiences encourage higher achievement” (Maughan & Webb, 2001).	
Studies have shown that staff who feel that they are rewarded beyond basic pay for work do show a greater loyalty to companies (Smith, 2007), and this was borne out by the large number of partners we had who had served over 25 years in the business.

While this has a positive impact on staff turnover, making the HR job easier in some ways, it did also mean that some longer-serving employees could be resistant to change, feeling that they had seen change fail before and knew how things worked best in their situation.

What next?

(Outcome)

Experience

What have I learned?
What would I do differently next time?
Learning

What else do I need to find out?
How can it be applied in the future, even in my professional life?
Ultimately, our group achieved a successful outcome, but to improve our achievement, we perhaps needed a chairperson to help encourage cooperation when tasks were being shared out. In future group work (on the course and at work), I would probably suggest this.	
I had to try and explain a minimal change in the pay-date for employees to one member of staff who made it clear that he did not feel I had enough experience. I was disheartened, as I had to pass this up to my manager and felt I had been treated dismissively due to a perceived lack of experience. I realised that in the particular instance, I could have pointed out that other, long serving members of staff had been positive about the change in staff forums.

However, I also found out that the change had not been widely disseminated to staff not involved in the forums. Many studies into change management highlight the need for clear communication and direction in the case of change from senior staff (Pratchett, 2010; Priestley, 2011). While I had no influence over this in this instance, it has made me think about how HR departments communicate with staff.

Another model you can use for your reflections is the Gibbs Reflective Cycle:



(Taylor, S. (2020) ePortfolios for Educators.  Available from https://mahara.catalystdemo.co.uk/user/samtaylor/eportfolios-for-educators).

Each module where a reflective piece is required will give the word count for the reflection.  For more information on the reflective writing style, please visit the "Reflective Writing" section of the Study Skills Hub.</p>
						<h2>Professional Skills Matrix</h2>
								<p>In order to help you with your professional development, this matrix helps you ensure you are developing the required skills for your chosen role and have the evidence to prove that development. Ensure you complete it in line with your reflection. You will then need to then create an action plan based on your review. This does not need to be very long but will serve as a reminder at the end of your programmespecially if you complete a learning loop. You might find a SWOT analysis helpful in the completion of the matrix and the development of an action plan.</p>
							
						<h2>Learning Loop</h2>
								<p>This helps you to tie up your learning across the modules, for a holistic perspective of the programme.  You should then be able to apply it to your organisation’s work/project, where applicable.  The loop should also include a review of Skills Matrices and action plans from individual modules. You could share it with the Head of Computing at the end of your programme as part of your final feedback on the course.</p>
