							<h2>Artefacts</h2>
							<h3>Discussion 1</h3>
							<p><u>Initial Post</u></p>
							<p>Cyber Security is now a concern for everyone, whether we like it or not.  Companies can gain value from proving that they have sufficient security measures put in place on their systems, however ensuring that their partner’s systems are secure is proving just as important.  Businesses are more likely to partner with organisations that can prove their compliance with laws and regulations, and this works two fold.  For example, by gaining accreditation such as PCI-DSS, a series of security controls must be put in place.  This has the obvious benefit of securing their systems and data, however it also secures the trust that others have in them.  A business can show their customers and partners they are safer to deal with.  With the adoption of cloud computing and the change of work patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic, security can no longer always be centralised and the recent spate of attacks on 3rd party providers headlining in the news shows the importance for organisations to check the compliance of businesses they do business with.  Recent victims of such attacks include attacks on VoIP providers, MIMECast and perhaps most notoriously, SolarWinds.  The latter helps organisations manage their network and applications, and was previously a trusted name.  However, when hackers compromised their Orion product in 2020, it affected customers worldwide including businesses and the US Military.  (Constantin, 2020).  Such stories should not be surprising when in a recent UK survey, only 12% of businesses admitted they reviewed risks from their immediate supply chain.  (UK Government, 2021).  Any organisation that neglects putting in measures to protect themselves and ensure their wider boundaries are secure risk cyber attacks and data breaches.  This leaves them open not only to financial implications, but with an intangible cost of loss of customer confidence and lost future business.</p>

							<p><u>Summary Post</u></p>
							<p>The expansion of businesses and technology brings ever increasing attack points.  (Bee, 2021) expanded on this in his post to include the use of IoT devices and the particular decentralised topography of our mobile connected networks following the pandemic.  (Peuhkurinen, 2021; Paintsil, 2021) expanded this view further still to include mergers and acquisitions, and both used the Marriot acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts as an example.  Acquisitions, and indeed divestitures, are yet another potential attack point that I had not considered in my initial post.

My initial post was focused on the threat coming from attack vectors largely outside of one’s own domain, however (Peuhkurinen, 2021) made a good point in response regarding the difficulty of protecting oneself from third party attacks such as the one from SolarWinds.  While it is true organisations cannot be 100% sure their partners are themselves secure, they can ensure they are following best practices at all times in order to minimise their risk of exploitation.  Every company that has a connection to the internet or deals with a third party faces the same issues and must protect themselves as best they can from the threats that are out there, after all, no company ever has completely zero risk. 

The SolarWinds attack and the data breach suffered by Shell and many others earlier this year highlight the fact that attacks do not have to come at you directly.  (Shell, 2021)

One solution to mitigate this is due diligence, another is compliance.  There are a patchwork of frameworks, laws and standards available to guide organisations in to protecting themselves and to ensure that consumer data is kept secure.  Compliance in particular, although it has some way still to go, not only shows they can be trusted with sensitive data, but also pushes them to apply countermeasures to protect themselves and indeed their reputation, which will only support their future business.</p>

							<p>Summary Post</p>
							<p>Any device with an online presence has the ability to be attacked, and we must all ensure that barriers are raised to prevent various threats.  There are multiple ways to do this, and using defence in depth is a preferable approach.

From my initial discussion, the liveliest debate stemmed from patch management software.  On further investigation, the fact that 10 discussions for this topic used firewalls as an example of a security technology may be an indication of their obvious importance and potentially explain why they did not draw as much discussion.  Norton illustrate the biggest risks of not adopting a firewall as being open access, lost or compromised data, and network crashes (Johansen, 2021). These events would be disastrous for many organisations, and are relatively simply mitigated with the use of a firewall. 

Firewalls themselves need updating, and it goes to show that both software and hardware require a lifecycle. Simply installing is not enough, but monitoring, maintenance and careful decommission when a product has reached end of life is also now required.

Paintsil (2022) highlighted several high profile cyber-attacks that had been made possible due to software vulnerabilities not being patched properly, while Subramaniam (2022) considered that along with vulnerability management, patch management was “the cornerstone of any cyber security program”.

Havryliuk (2021) mentioned that managing software updates in a comprehensive way can be difficult, especially when so many other factors are demanding the security engineers’ attention.  This is absolutely true.  Managing software updates across a large enterprise can be a real challenge, and it can also be a challenge for smaller companies who cannot dedicate sufficient resource to the task.  However, patch management software is there to aid this, by providing automation for installation, and monitoring for large numbers of systems on a network.</p>

							<h2>Meeting Notes</h2>
								<p>It’s essential to keep a record of what your team’s activities in line with the guidelines set out on teamwork (see the Department of Computing page).  You should also record outcomes of any meetings with your tutor and as well as feedback you have received.</p>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							        <p>I felt like I put a lot of time and effort in to this module, so much so it was difficult to build a social life easily in to my week.  I remember heading at school that we write down what we learn as it makes it stick better.  I began writing as I read, which I realised I could improve by typing as I read.  This saved a LOT of time.
                                                                I also realised for the first time that I CANNOT listen to music as I read.  However, it helps to listen to music as I write / type, which is very useful to distinguish.
                                                                Overall I think I made my submissions in good time and produced a standard of work I was happy with.
                                                                I have also learnt more about academic writing, which I was not sure on before.  I feel that this knowledge will enable me to submit better work in future modules.
                                                                I read a LOT of text for this module, and I am all the better for it.  Reading is not something I would enjoy as a leisure activity.  
                                                                My portfolio skills must have surely improved.
                                                                I have learnt a new coding language (Python) which I will definitely be using in the future.  I have also learnt Github at a basic level and about UML and how it can be used.  The other technologies and methodologies I broadly had some knowledge of, but the work done in the module has increased my understanding.  Django is one technology I had not come across before, and I may spend the 2 week break reading the book from the reading list.</p>
						<h2>Professional Skills Matrix</h2>
								<p>In order to help you with your professional development, this matrix helps you ensure you are developing the required skills for your chosen role and have the evidence to prove that development. Ensure you complete it in line with your reflection. You will then need to then create an action plan based on your review. This does not need to be very long but will serve as a reminder at the end of your programmespecially if you complete a learning loop. You might find a SWOT analysis helpful in the completion of the matrix and the development of an action plan.</p>
							
						<h2>Learning Loop</h2>
								<p>This helps you to tie up your learning across the modules, for a holistic perspective of the programme.  You should then be able to apply it to your organisation’s work/project, where applicable.  The loop should also include a review of Skills Matrices and action plans from individual modules. You could share it with the Head of Computing at the end of your programme as part of your final feedback on the course.</p>
