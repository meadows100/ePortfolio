							<h2>Artefacts</h2>
							<h2>Feedback</h2>
								<p>It’s essential to keep a record of what your team’s activities in line with the guidelines set out on teamwork (see the Department of Computing page).  You should also record outcomes of any meetings with your tutor and as well as feedback you have received.</p>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<h3>Unit 1</h3>
								This was my second module and to begin with, I found this to be quite comfortable compared to the last.  Firstly this is because of the fact the module is only 6 weeks long, and not 15 weeks compared to the first one.  Secondly, I feel because I do not have to learn academic writing I feel that I have less of a burden.  I have studied risk management before in 2019, and I feel confident for the module ahead.
							<h3>Unit 2</h3>
								I have done a lot of reading in this week, and I feel I have been able to contribute to the group very positively.  As a group, we already have a very good status report which I am sure only needs some tweaking for it to be ready for submission.  My role in the team has been to take minutes of meetings, and to contribute to the assignment like everyone else.  I feel I have done this to a good standard.
							<h3>Unit 3</h3>
								We have submitted the report and my peer response feedback.  I also continued a lot of reading around risk information management and feel very well versed.  I believe that I contributed to a good, and well run project, and I am anticipating positive results.  However, there’s not much I can do about it now!  It was also much busier this week, a deadline may have been a contributing factor.  I also had a 1 to 1 with the tutor which definitely helped settle my nerves regarding the direction we were headed with the report.  I am eagerly anticipating the next assignment, following a well earned day off.
							<h3>Unit 4</h3>
								I attended the seminar on Thursday, and attended 2 group meetings either side.  The next meeting is Saturday and I am a bit apprehensive that it leaves us only 9 days to hand in the 2 pieces of work due on the following Monday.  I have done so much reading for this project that I feel armed, however the next 2 weeks will be dedicated to writing that into practice.  I feel motivated, perhaps by the pressure of the tight schedule.
							<h3>Unit 5</h3>
								This week has felt a bit disjointed.  I feel we are still not decided on a risk management framework, we have not yet completed a risk assessment, and am concerned we will not have a completed coherent product in good time.  Risk Management Frameworks can be hundreds of pages long, and I have not fully researched one of the frameworks we are working on.  This being said, I know I do tend to work better under pressure and have a long holiday weekend coming which I am hoping to also use to finish my Individual Reflection.  I also feel that some of my concerns have not been understood this week, which has left me feeling frustrated.  It could be because I have not been strong enough in getting my point across.  The group has 1 more meeting scheduled for this week, I hope we can pull it together and iron out anything we have left to do. 
							<h3>Unit 6</h3>
						<h2>Professional Skills Matrix</h2>
								<p>In order to help you with your professional development, this matrix helps you ensure you are developing the required skills for your chosen role and have the evidence to prove that development. Ensure you complete it in line with your reflection. You will then need to then create an action plan based on your review. This does not need to be very long but will serve as a reminder at the end of your programmespecially if you complete a learning loop. You might find a SWOT analysis helpful in the completion of the matrix and the development of an action plan.</p>
							
						<h2>Learning Loop</h2>
								<p>This helps you to tie up your learning across the modules, for a holistic perspective of the programme.  You should then be able to apply it to your organisation’s work/project, where applicable.  The loop should also include a review of Skills Matrices and action plans from individual modules. You could share it with the Head of Computing at the end of your programme as part of your final feedback on the course.</p>
