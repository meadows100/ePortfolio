							<table><tr><td>Individual Essay</td><td><ul>The issues are well-chosen and appropriate for the topic. You have picked some interesting areas to focus on. <br></ul>

									<ul>Some good critical discussion where you have clearly thought about the issues and have a good understanding of the material.<br> </ul>

									<ul>Good selection of references	<br><br></ul>

									<ul>Well-presented throughout and easy to read.</ul></td></tr>
								<tr><td>Application of Knowledge</td> <td>You have done well to consider the security risks to your domain and have considered some solutions to address these issues. It would be good to see more detail around how the approach you have chosen to take will be mitigating these risks.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Criticality</td> <td>You have constructed a good selection of diagrams to detail your design and development plan. You have clearly considered how the user interacts with the system. Try to ensure continuity through your diagrams however, for instance, your sequence diagram details a slightly different process to your activity diagram. I am not sure that you have total consensus on how the application is to be developed going forwards.  More critical thinking and justification of choices would be development points for this assignment.</td></tr>
								<tr><td>Structure & Presentation</td> <td>You have referenced really well and used relevant examples to the content of your design document. It would be good to have seen the list of tools and libraries to be used, up in the main document and the OWASP and stride details down in the appendix, as the tools and libraries tables show the team’s thinking better than te infographics.</td></tr>

							<h2>Feedback (Implementation Project)</h2>
							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<h3>Unit 1</h3>
								<p>The first week, as always, has been dedicated to reading as much material as possible.  The first week has been the busiest in many of my modules to date, and this has been no different.  I managed to get through a lot of material and will continue through the next week.</p>
							<h3>Unit 2</h3>
								<p>A slightly nervous week.  I had doubts that I would be able to submit a meaningful essay, I believe this was because it is the first individual module I have been tasked with for 2 months.  This has subsided and I am now focused on the reading which I know will give me what I need for a good result.</p>
							<h3>Unit 3</h3>
								<p>I feel I have caught up on the reading this week and am in a good place for the module.  I also submitted my essay early, and as I was writing it, realised I could write some much content, of which I had not understood before.  I am feeling very confident at this point.</p>
							<h3>Unit 4</h3>
								<p>I am in a good place for the presentation.  The essay and peer reviews are handed in, almost all my reading is complete and I feel I have the knowledge and confidence required to deliver a well-formed presentation at the end of week 6.  I am feeling much more relaxed.</p>
							<h3>Unit 5</h3>
								<p>I believe I am in a good position.  I have competed the assignment transcript, however I need to prepare for the presentation, however I feel comfortable that a week is more than long enough!  I have put in a lot of work in terms of research and now feel very comfortable I will be able to meet the deadline.</p>
							<h3>Unit 6</h3>
								<p></p>
						<h2>Professional Skills Matrix</h2>
								<p><img src="proskillSSD.png"></p>
						<h2>Action Plan</h2>
							<p>In my Individual Reflection, I specified I would like to improve my proficiency in using GitHub.  This is a very useful collaborative coding tool, which is also used at my workplace.  Although I do not use it in my role, I do feel it would benefit me if I were to understand exactly how to get the most out of it.  I plan to improve my knowledge by watching some short courses on LinkedIn Learning or YouTube, for example.  
								I do not code, and so I do not see any time in the future where I will need to design an application.  For this, I do not currently feel the need to learn any more about Flask, unless I did it for fun.  However, I do see more value in improving my knowledge around Python.  Again, I do not have any plans, however if I find a need to create a function or app which will increase my life in some way, I will definitely look to choose Python.  I plan to improve my skills by simply practicing, and there is more than sufficient content available online whenever I get stuck with a problem.</p>
						<h2>Learning Loop</h2>
								<p>This helps you to tie up your learning across the modules, for a holistic perspective of the programme.  You should then be able to apply it to your organisation’s work/project, where applicable.  The loop should also include a review of Skills Matrices and action plans from individual modules. You could share it with the Head of Computing at the end of your programme as part of your final feedback on the course.</p>
