							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<h3>Unit 1</h3>
								<p>A slow week in terms of summative work.  The team has not been formed yet and the seminar was only attended by myself and was very short.  I have spent the week reading lots of material to get myself prepared for when the real work begins.</p>
							<h3>Unit 2</h3>
								<p>Again, a slow week.  It has been decided that the team will consist of all 7 participants of the module, however we have not had any work done at this point, and we have only one meeting held.  I was frustrated I was unable to join this.  We have a meeting tomorrow, I hope we can make some good ground in this.  My role in the team has been to take minutes of meetings, and to contribute to the assignment like everyone else.  I feel I have done this to a good standard.</p>
							<h3>Unit 3</h3>
								<p>A very busy week getting the Design Document in.  I felt very motivated to get as good a project in as possible and I took on a lot of work personally to get it done.  Probably too much, but was I mentioned before, I have problems letting go!  The project is in, however, and I believe we have made a very good submission.</p>
							<h3>Unit 4</h3>
								<p></p>
							<h3>Unit 5</h3>

							<h3>Unit 6</h3>

						<h2>Professional Skills Matrix</h2>
								<p>In order to help you with your professional development, this matrix helps you ensure you are developing the required skills for your chosen role and have the evidence to prove that development. Ensure you complete it in line with your reflection. You will then need to then create an action plan based on your review. This does not need to be very long but will serve as a reminder at the end of your programmespecially if you complete a learning loop. You might find a SWOT analysis helpful in the completion of the matrix and the development of an action plan.</p>
							
						<h2>Learning Loop</h2>
								<p>This helps you to tie up your learning across the modules, for a holistic perspective of the programme.  You should then be able to apply it to your organisation’s work/project, where applicable.  The loop should also include a review of Skills Matrices and action plans from individual modules. You could share it with the Head of Computing at the end of your programme as part of your final feedback on the course.</p>
